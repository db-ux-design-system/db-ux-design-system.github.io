Colors play a central role in the design of user interfaces. They can reinforce messages and help communicate meanings, as well as enable targeted user guidance.

## Guidelines

###### Background & On-Background

The entire color system is based on the principle that there are defined backgrounds (bg) with matching content colors (on-bg). There are four different groups: Basic, Inverted, Vibrant & Origin. The corresponding bg and on-bg tokens always belong together and should not be mixed. This ensures contrast, readability, and consistency.

		fullWidth={true}
		description="Always combine the matching on-bg token with the respective bg token."
	/>
</div>

###### Accessibility

For accessible design, text needs a 4.5:1 contrast ratio, while icons can have a 3:1 contrast ratio. For basic backgrounds, you should only use on-bg-basic-emphasis-100, -90, or -80 for text. For icons, -70 is also permitted. In the Inverted group, you should only place text on bg-inverted-contrast-max or -contrast-high. Icons can also be placed on -contrast-low. In Figma, the use of color in typography is scoped, which ensures this rule is followed. When layering multiple backgrounds, the system cannot guarantee accessibility. In this case, each individual case must be checked and, if necessary, contrast must be ensured by using a border (e.g., bg-vibrant on bg-basic).

		fullWidth={true}
		description="Follow the rule to ensure accessibility."
	/>
</div>

###### Adaptive Coloring

Use adaptive tokens by default. Due to the identical structure of the individual color palettes, elements can easily be placed in a different color context. If a data-color is assigned to a container, all elements within it are recolored in the selected color context. Explicitly colored elements that do not use adaptive color tokens are not affected by the data-color. Take a look at the playground for a better understanding.
